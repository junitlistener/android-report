# android-report

This project allows to listen to Junit events (like test finished) and create a report (xml format) in the mobile device 
There is no need for ADB connection or using IDE to get the test result 

This project is a 'fork'  from http://zutubi.com/source/projects/android-junit-report/

I created this 'fork' as the above code didnt worked for me on android OS 4+
